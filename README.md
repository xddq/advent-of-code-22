# Solving advent of code challenges in Common Lisp (sbcl)

- [2021](https://github.com/xddq/aoc2021-haskell)
- What is advent of code? [homepage](https://adventofcode.com/)
- After the hate-love relationship with haskell in last years challenges (love
  won by a lot) I want to continue trying languages with new concepts I am
interested in.
- This year, I am trying out *common lisp for the first time*. I have heard
  something about macro usage and the REPl integration and will try to play
around with that.
- Will only do the first 5 days due to time constraints. Might continue, but
  highly unlikely.

# Setup and execution
- start sbcl server in current root dir: `sbcl --load $HOME/.vim/plugged/vlime/lisp/start-vlime.lisp`
- connect to sbcl server in vim via vlime
- open file for given day, eval main, run main
